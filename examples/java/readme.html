<h1>Java Examples</h1>
<p>This directory contains a few examples on how to use the Okapi library with 
your own Java programs. The examples have been pre-compiled. If you wish to 
modify them and re-compile you will need to have Maven (<a href="http://maven.apache.org/">http://maven.apache.org/</a>) 
to execute the build.</p>
<h2>Example01</h2>
<p>This example shows how to create and execute a pipeline with three or four 
steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The first step converts a given input document into a set of filter 
	events, using the appropriate filter for the given input document.</li>
	<li>The second step pseudo-translate the translatable text of the input 
	document.</li>
	<li>The third step converts all letters of the translatable text into 
	uppercases.</li>
	<li>The fourth step re-create the original document with the modified text.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to run both middle steps or just one of them from the 
command-line option.</p>
<h2>Example02</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This example takes a properties file or an OpenOffice.org document 
and print to the console all translatable text. The inline codes inside the text 
are displayed with generic markers such as: <code>&lt;1&gt;</code>...<code>&lt;/1&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;2/&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2>Example03</h2>
<p>This example takes a file <code>test.xml</code> (complied into the jar, but 
you can see it in the <code>src</code> directory) and runs a pipeline with four 
steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">The first step takes the input document and processes it with a 
	first XSLT template that just re-create the input to an output.</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">The second step takes the output f the first one, and processes 
	with a second XSLT template that removes <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> nodes.</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">The third step takes the output of the second one and converts 
	the document into filter events, using the XML filter.</li>
	<li>
	<p dir="ltr">The fourth step takes the filter events sent by the third step 
	and create an output stream. Then that output is displayed on the standard 
	output.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example04</h2>
<p>This example shows some of the functionality provided by the segmenter 
included in the Okapi Library. It uses the <code>myRules.srx</code> SRX file 
included in the sample files to segment some example text.</p>
<h2>Example05</h2>
<p>This example shows how to use some of the TM query connectors that are 
provided with the Okapi Library. The first part demonstrate how to query the 
public OpenTran Web server. The second part shows how to query a GlobalSight TM 
server, using its Web services. You should have a running server to try that 
one.</p>
