<h2>Overview</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Okapi Framework is a <b>cross-platform</b> and <b>open-source</b> set of
<b>components</b> <b>and applications</b> that offer extensive support for localizing and translating documentation and software.</p>
<p>The goal of the Okapi Framework is to allow tools developers and 
localizers to build new localization processes or enhance existing ones to best 
meet their needs, while preserving compatibility and 
interoperability. The project uses and promotes 
<a href="standards.html">open 
standards</a>, when they exist. The source code, issue list and downloads of the project are hosted on Google 
code: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/okapi/">http://code.google.com/p/okapi/</a>. Okapi is pronounced <i>o-ka-py</i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/audio.pl?okapi001.wav=okapi">hear 
it</a>).</p>

<p class="smallnote">Note: This web site is dedicated to the <b>Java implementation</b> of the Okapi 
Framework. There is an older .NET implementation as well. New development is now done in the Java branch. The Web site for <a href="http://okapi.sourceforge.net">
Okapi NET is hosted on SourceForge</a> and is still available.</p>
<h2>Using the Okapi Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="applications.html#Rainbow">Rainbow</a></b> is a GUI 
	application to launch various utilities related to translation and 
	localization tasks, such as: Text extraction (to XLIFF, OmegaT projects, 
	RTF, etc.) and merging, pre-translation, encoding conversion, terms 
	extraction, file format conversions, quality verification, translation 
	comparison, search and replace on filtered text, pseudo-translation, and 
	much more. Using the framework's pipeline mechanism, you can use Rainbow to 
	create chains of steps that perform pecific set of tasks specific to your 
	needs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><cite><a href="applications.html#CheckMate">CheckMate</a></cite> is a 
	GUI application that performs various quality checks on bilingual 
	translation files such as XLIFF, TMX, TTX, PO, TS, Trados-Tagged RTF, and 
	any other bilingual format supported by the Okapi framework.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="applications.html#Ratel">Ratel</a></b> is a GUI application 
	to create and maintain 
	segmentation rules. Such rules are used to break down translatable text in 
	more meaningful parts. Ratel implements an SRX-based engine. 
	<a href="standards.html#srx">SRX is the 
	Segmentation Rules eXchange format</a>. The application includes an 
	integrated test that allows you to see immediately the effects of your 
	segmentation rules on your example text as you edit the rules.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="applications.html#Tikal">Tikal</a></b> is a 
	command-line tool that offers many functions, including: simple 
	extraction/merging, various file format conversions (TMX, CSV, 
	tab-delimited, PO, etc.), access to translation resources, import/export for 
	the Pensieve TM, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using the Okapi Components</h2>
<p>The framework is made of many Java components that share a set of common APIs: 
Filters, translation resource connectors, segmenters, steps, etc. here are some 
examples of those components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <b><a href="help/filters/regex/ui/index.html">Regex Filter</a></b> 
	is a filter component that provides you a way to read and write any 
	text-based file and extract text parts using regular expressions. It 
	implements the programming interface common to the all the Okapi filters. 
	This simplify the development of programs or scripts to perform any type of 
	tasks on the translatable text of the files.
	The framework offers <a href="help/filters/index.html">filters for many other file formats</a>, such as: HTML, 
	XML, OpenOffice files, Microsoft Office's DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, Properties, 
	DITA, ResX, PO, 
	XLIFF, TMX, DTD, TS, TTX, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The <cite><a href="help/applications/tikal/index.html#google">Google-MT 
	Connector</a></cite> is one of the translation resource connectors 
	implemented in the framework. You easily try out the Okapi connectors using
	<a href="help/applications/tikal/index.html#query">Tikal's <code>-q</code> 
	command</a>. Many other services are supported: 
	Micosoft-MT, OpenTran, TAUS-TDA, MyMemory, Apertium, Translate-Toolkit TM, 
	GlobalSight TM, Okapi's own Pensieve TM, and more. Using the same API, other 
	components can leverage local and remote translation resources for TM, MT 
	terms, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The <cite><a href="help/steps/termextractionstep.html">Term Extraction</a></cite> 
	steps allows you to generate lists of possible multi-words terms from any 
	file formats supported by the framework. It is one of the many steps that 
	can be used in customized pipelines. Some other steps available are for 
	example: Segmentation, Code Removal, Diff Leverage, XSL Transform, 
	Leveraging, and many more.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Beyond using existing tools and components you can also easily develop 
programs and scripts that use the framework's components to create customized 
solutions for your specific needs. <a href="developers.html">See the Developers 
Notes page</a> for more details on this. The Okapi libraries are available as a 
	downloadable distribution here
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/okapi/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/okapi/downloads/list</a>, as well as through a 
	Maven repository here: <a href="http://openl10n.net/maven2/releases/">http://openl10n.net/maven2/releases/</a>.</li>
