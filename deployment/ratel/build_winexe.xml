	<!--
	This file build ratel.exe only. It should be run only when something changes in the .exe configuration or
	for some reasons the .exe needs to be updated.
	The built .exe is placed in data/win32-x86_nocopy and is under version control
	This means the main ratel build can be done a) without installing launch4j and b) on non-Windows platforms.
