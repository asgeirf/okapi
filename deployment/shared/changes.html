<h2>Changes from M12 to M13-SNAPSHOT</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Rainbow:<ul>
	<li>Added the user preference &quot;Use the last session&#39;s locales and encodings 
	as defaults&quot;.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>CheckMate:<ul>
	<li>Fixed the null pointer issue when target pattern different from the 
	source match were not found.</li>
	<li>Added check of the opening/closing sequence for inline codes. This check 
	is done only if no other error is found in the segment.</li>
	<li>Added the option &quot;Try to guess opening/closing types for placeholder 
	codes&quot; for the codes.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Tikal:<ul>
	<li>Added the -a command to add translations to a resource.</li>
	<li>Fixed usage screen for minor details.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Steps:<ul>
	<li>Rainbow Translation Kit Creation Step:<ul>
	<li>Changed the XLIFF and XLIFF + RTF output behavior so single and double 
	quotes are not escaped in element content.</li>
	<li>Changed the XLIFF + RTF output to use short notation for empty inline 
	codes.<br>
	<u><b>IMPORTANT</b></u>: This updated notation may have impact on TM matches 
	using the previous notation. Some TM tools will have coded the two parts
	<code>&lt;x id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/x&gt;</code>&nbsp; as two separate inline 
	codes (because they are styled as two spans of tw4winInternal) and will see 
	the new notation <code>&lt;x id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</code>&nbsp; as a single code. For 
	Trados-2007 TM for example you may want to update your TM by replacing the 
	two adjacent codes with a single one. Export the TM to TMX 1.4b, replace
	<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif"><code>
	&lt;bpt\s.*?&gt;&amp;lt;x id=&amp;quot;(\d\d?)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/bpt&gt;&lt;ept\s.*?&gt;&amp;lt;/x&amp;gt;&lt;/ept&gt;</code> 
	by <code>&lt;ph&gt;&amp;lt;x id=&amp;quot;\1&amp;quot;/&gt;&lt;/ph&gt;</code> and create a new TM based 
	on the modified notation. That new TM should yield segments that will match 
	with the new notation.</span></li>
	<li>Added the option &quot;Create a ZIP file for the package&quot;</li>
	<li>Continued experimental implementation of XLIFF 2.0.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Rainbow Translation Kit Merging Step:<ul>

	of the screen.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Added the Microsoft Batch Translation Step: it allows to batch translate 
	resources using the Microsoft Translator TM/MT engine (the Collaborative 
	Translations Framework)</li>
	<li>Added the Microsoft Batch Submission Step: it allows to 
	submit human or post-edited translations to the Microsoft Collaborative Translations Framework. 
	Those translations can be retrieved later.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Filters:<ul>
	<li>XLIFF Filter:<ul>
	<li>Added internal flag to output un-escaped single and double quotes.</li>

	codes are nested over parts.</li>
	<li>Updated how outer data of empty inline codes are stored (e.g. now uses 
	<code>&lt;x id=&#39;1&#39;/&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;x id=&#39;1&#39;&gt;&lt;/x&gt;</code>)</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>PHP Content Filter:<ul>
	<li>Fixed the case of multiple placeholder codes with the same ID. This 
	fixes issue #179.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>IDML Filter:<ul>
	<li>Implemented extraction of master spreads (as an option set by default).</li>
	<li>Fixed bug of in the simplification of trailing inline codes after a 
	single character.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Connectors:<ul>
		<li>Microsoft Translator Connector:<ul>
			<li>Changed the name from Microsoft MT Connector (since it handles more than 
	MT matches)</li>
			<li>Implemented ITMQuery and multiple results.</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Libraries:<ul>

	leverage translation from a Moses text file)</span></li>
	<li><span class="str">Added the XML Analysis Step (to generate the list of

<h2>Changes from M8 to M9</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Rainbow:<ul>
	<li>Translation package Post-Processing utility:<ul>
	<li>Fixed the bug where pre-translated XLIFF entries with translate=&#39;no&#39; 
	could not be merged back properly, for example for PO files.</li>

	<li><u><b>IMPORTANT</b></u>: Changed the H2 database dependency from version 
	1.1.103 (.data.db files) to 1.2.135 (.h2.db files), this breaks backward 
	compatibility: the new SimpleTM connector cannot open the old .data.db 
	files. To convert an older TM: Use a M8 or prior version of Rainbow to run 
	the <b>SimpleTM to TMX</b> step to export your database to TMX. Then, Use

	added. It allows you to easily script run pipelines, for example using 
	Jython.</li>
