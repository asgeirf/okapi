Deploying
=========

--- 0) Keep track of the changes between release in the Changes Log

- trunk/deployment/shared/changes.html


--- 1) Make sure all unit tests pass

Do a full rebuild of the Maven build:
mvn clean install from /trunk


--- 2) Make sure the following files have the proper version and release numbers for this release:

- All the POM.XML files
- trunk/deployment/shared/release.properties


--- 3) Make also sure the readme files are up-to-date:

- trunk/deployment/maven/okapi-lib/readme.html
- trunk/deployment/maven/okapi-apps/readme.html


--- 4) Rebuild all

Run "mvn clean install" in /trunk
Then run "ant" in /trunk/deployment/maven

This will re-compile, tests, and create packages.
Then rebuild all distributions for all platforms.

--- Update the Okapi Public repository with the proper JARs
(So the examples can be build using Maven)


TO-UPDATE: --- 5) Go to trunk/deployment/rainbow/tests and run the build.xml there. It runs the integration tests for Rainbow and exercises many of the components of the library.

The file _tests_results.txt shows any differences between the expected results and the curren ones. Note that some differences may be fine if they are coming from a fix or a new feature. Update the gold files if it is the case.


--- 6) Post each packge (.zip or .gz) of the distributions to the GoogleCode download area.
Use the following summary, in this order:
Okapi Libraries for all platforms (GZIP)
Okapi Libraries for all platforms (ZIP)
Okapi Applications for Macintosh Carbon
Okapi Applications for Macintosh Cocoa
Okapi Applications for Linux 64-bit
Okapi Applications for Linux
Okapi Applications for Windows

--- 7) Update the Web site with any files that was modified in trunk/website. Usually at least the JavaDoc, the updates.html and the downloads.html should be updated.

Host: ftp.opentag.com
Username: same as for the shared documents
Password: same as for the shared documents
Start directory: okapi

The structure in the okapi directory is the same as in trunk/website


--- 8) Post a notification that a new release is available.
