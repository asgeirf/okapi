Deploying
=========

--- 0) Keep track of the changes between release in the Changes Log

- trunk/deployment/shared/changes.html


--- 1) Make sure all unit tests pass

Do a full rebuild of the Maven build:
mvn clean install from /trunk


--- 2) Make sure the following files have the proper version and release numbers for this release:

- trunk/deployment/shared/release.properties


--- 3) Make also sure the readme files are up-to-date:

- trunk/deployment/maven/okapi-lib/readme.html
- trunk/deployment/maven/okapi-apps/readme.html


--- 4) Run trunk/deployment/build.xml
This will rebuild all distributions for all platforms.


TO-UPDATE: --- 5) Go to trunk/deployment/rainbow/tests and run the build.xml there. It runs the integration tests for Rainbow and exercises many of the components of the library.

The file _tests_results.txt shows any differences between the expected results and the curren ones. Note that some differences may be fine if they are coming from a fix or a new feature. Update the gold files if it is the case.


--- 6) Post each packge (.zip or .gz) of the distributions to the GoogleCode download area.


--- 7) Update the Web site with any files that was modified in trunk/website. Usually at least the JavaDoc, the updates.html and the downloads.html should be updated.

Host: ftp.opentag.com
