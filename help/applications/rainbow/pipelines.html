<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>A pipeline is a customizable set of steps that take the input documents 
provided in the input lists of Rainbow and execute each step in sequential 
order.</p>
<p>A step is a small unit of execution. It take a specific input, perform its 
task on it and send a specific output to the next step in the pipeline.</p>
<h2><a name="BasicDocDriven"></a>Basic Raw Document-Base Pipeline</h2>
<p>Some step act directly on the raw document without going through 
extraction/merging, for example when they perform tasks on the fille as a whole 
rather than its translatable text.</p>
<p>For example, the step named &quot;Encoding Conversion&quot; reads a text file (without 
any filter) in a given encoding, and re-writes it in a different one. This step 
can be used in a one-step pipeline:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Encoding Conversion</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="BasicFilterDriven"></a>Basic Filter-Driven Pipeline</h2>
<p>For example, the step named &quot;Full-Width Conversion&quot;:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Its input is a set of filter events.</li>
	<li>Its taks is to convert the content of the extracted text that is send 
	through text unit events in either full-width Japanese character, or 
	half-width ASCII/ depending on what option is selected.</li>
	<li>Its output is the same filter events it recieved, with the modified text 
	in the case of the text unit events.</li>
</ul>
<p>This step is not design to work alone: it needs to be fed filter events, and 
the text it modifies needs to be written out somewhere.</p>
<p>To fed a step with filter events you simply need a step just before that 
output filter events. This could be the &quot;Raw Document to Filter Events&quot; step 
which takes a normal file and creates the extracted data using the filters.</p>
<p>To re-write the filter events modified by the step you simply need one of the 
step that takes filter events as input and produce a raw document as output. 
This could be the &quot;Filter Events to Raw Document&quot; step which takes the filter 
events and create an output file in the original file format.</p>
<p>So you useable pipeline to convert the content of any input file that can be 
filtered will be made of three steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Raw Document to Filter Events</li>
	<li>Full-Width Conversion</li>
	<li>Filter events to Raw Document</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="MultiTasks"></a>Multi-Tasks Pipelines</h2>
<p>The real power of pipelines really comes to light when you chain multiple 
steps without having to re-extract the text, or perform different raw-document 
taks one after the other automatically.</p>
<h2><a name="FAQ"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Q: How do I specify what filter configuration to use with &quot;Raw Document to 
Filter Events&quot;?<br>
A: In the Rainbow Input List tabs, you associate one filter configuration per 
input file.</p>
<p>Q: How do I specify the name of the output file?<br>
A: In the Rainbow&#39;s Output tab, you can define the names and locations of all 
the input files based on their input file paths.</p>
<p>Q: How many steps can I chain together?<br>
A: There is no specific limit to the number of steps in a pipeline, only the 
available memory will limit what you can do (and pipelines do not take up a lof 
of memory).</p>
