<h1>Versions</h1>

freeware (from version 1 to version 4). Then, with Rainbow 5, it moved to become 
an open-source project under the Okapi Framework.</p>
<p>There are two branches currently supported:</p>
<p><b>Rainbow 5</b> -- It is a .NET application that is still maintained but 
where no new developments will be done. This application is part of the Okapi 
Framework developped on the .NET platform.</p>
<p><b>Rainbow 6</b> -- It is a Java application and the version this help is 
meant for. Rainbow 6 is the latest Rainbow application. This application is part 
of the Okapi Framework on the Java platform which is the most recent iteration
