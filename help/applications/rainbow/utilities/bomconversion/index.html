<h1 class="util1">Utility – Byte-Order-Mark Conversion</h1>
<h2 class="util2">Overview</h2>
<p>This utility allows you to add a Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) to UTF-8 and UTF-16 files and remove the Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) from 
UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 files.</p>
<p>The Byte-Order-Mark (or BOM) is a special Unicode mark that is used 
to indicate if a file is in little-endian (U+FEFF) or big-endian (U+FFFE) mode. For more 
information on the BOM see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html">
http://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html</a>.</p>
<p>This utility does not use filters.</p>
<h2>Input Parameters</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The list of the input documents to modify (Input list 1).</li>
	<li>The names and locations of the output documents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Options Tab</h3>
<h4>Actions on the Byte-Order-Mark</h4>
<p><cite>Remove the Byte-Order-Mark if it is present</cite> -- Select this 
option to remove the BOM from the input files if one is detected. By default 
only the BOM of UTF-8 files are removed.</p>
<p><cite>Remove also UTF-16 and UTF-32 BOMs</cite> -- Select this option to also 
remove the BOM from UTF-16 and UTF-32 files if one is detected. This is not 
something that is recommended: UTF-16 and UTF-32 files must have a BOM.</p>
<p><cite>Add the Byte-Order-Mark if it is not already present</cite> -- Select 
this option to add a BOM in the input files if one is not detected. Note that 
the input files must be in UTF-8 or UTF-16. When adding a BOM this utility tries to determine if the encoding of the file is UTF-16. If it can't determine this it will assume the file is encoded as UTF-8. Because auto detection of UTF-16 file is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate, using UTF-8 files would be preferable. See the <a href="../encodingconversion/index.html">
Encoding Conversion Utility</a> for converting between encodings.
