<h1 class="util1">Utility – Search And Replace</h1>
<h2 class="util2">Overview</h2>
<p>The Search And replace utility allows you to search for a set of text 
patterns and replace then with another. You can use regular expression if needed. 
The input files can be read through the filters, or as plain text.</p>
<h2>Input Parameters</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The list of the source documents to search and replace (Input list 1). </li>
	<li>Default input encoding. </li>
	<li>Location and names for output files.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Options Tab</h3>
<p>The items list contains three columns:
<ul>
	<li>The <cite>Use</cite> column where a check box indicates if the item should be used (checked) or not (un-checked).</li>
	<li>The <cite>Search for</cite> column where the text or regular expression to search for is displayed.</li>
	<li>The <cite>Replace by</cite> column where the replacement text or regular expression is displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To edit an item : Double-click the item, or click the <cite>Edit</cite> button. To check and un-check an item: Click the checkbox, or press 
<kbd>Space</kbd> when the item is selected.</p>
<p><cite>Add</cite> -- Click this button to add a new item in the list. This opens the 
	<cite><a href="editItem.html">Search and Replace Item</a></cite> dialog box.</p>
<p><cite>Edit</cite> -- Click this button to edit the item currently selected. This opens the 
	<cite><a href="editItem.html">Search and Replace Item</a></cite> dialog box.</p>
<p><cite>Remove</cite> -- Click this button to remove the item currently selected from the list.</p>
<p><cite>Move Up</cite> -- Click this button to move the item currently selected upward.</p>
<p><cite>Move Down</cite> -- Click this button to move the item currently selected downward.</p>
<p><cite>Process the files as plain text</cite> -- Set this option to process the input files as plain text, that is without reading them through a filter. When this option is set: all parts of the file are searched, also the file is seen exactly like it would be in a text editor (no conversion of escaped characters is done for example). when this option is not set: only the text seen as translatable by the filter associated with the input file will be modified.</p>
<p><cite>Use regular expressions</cite> -- Set this option to enable the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Regular Expressions</a> mode.</p>
<h4>Regular expression options</h4>
<p>When this option is checked several regular expression options are accessible. They apply to all expressions, not just the selected one:</p>
<p><cite>Ignore case</cite> -- Set this option to ignore the cases in the matches. for example "bear" matches "Bearcat", "BEARCAT", and "bearcat".</p>
<p><cite>Multiline</cite> -- Set this option to changes the meaning of <code>^</code> and
<code>$</code> so that they match at the beginning and end of any line, not just the beginning and end of the whole string.</p>
<p><cite>Dot also matches line-feed</cite> -- Set this option to changes the meaning of the period character '<code>.</code>' so that it matches every character instead of every character except
<code>\n</code>.</p>
