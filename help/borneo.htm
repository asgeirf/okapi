<h1>Borneo</h1>
<p>Borneo is a simple Java application to manage localization projects.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A project is made of a set of documents that are extracted into a database. A 
document is any input that is supported by one of the filters provided along 
with Borneo. Currently there are filters for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Java and .NET Properties files</li>
	<li>JSON files</li>
</ul>
<p>The extracted data go through different steps, the last one being the 
generation of the translated document. Borneo does not provide a translation 
environment, but creates translation packages for various translation tools.</p>
<h2>Creating a New Project</h2>
<h3>1. Select the type of database to use</h3>
<p>Borneo can currently work with two types of database: H2 and MySQL v5.x.</p>
<p>Borneo uses two locations to store a project: Extracted text, translations, 
language information, and most of the project data are stored in a database. But 
Borneo also keep track of the original files you are including to the project, 
and keeps multiple copies of them has they go through the localization process. 
These files are called &quot;stored files&quot; are are kept in a special directory 
structure.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use H2 for local projects, where both the database and the stored files 
	are located on local hard-drive. All files are in the same project 
	directory. This server is embedded in Borneo and you have nothing to do to 
	set it up.</li>
	<li>Use MySQL for remote projects, where the database is located on a remote 
	server, and the stored files are located on a shared network drive. Here 
	database and stored files may be on different machines depending on your 
	configuration. To use MySQL you must have MySQL installed on a server, and 
	have access to database instance. MySQL is free and widely used.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you start Borneo, no database type is selected. Once you have selected 
one, all project-related functions (open project, create new projects, etc.) are 
done in relation to the selected server. You can select a different serve at any 
time.</p>
<p>Choose the command <cite>Select Server</cite> from the <cite>File</cite> 
menu.</p>
<p>Select the database type. In this example, we will choose &quot;Internal server - 
H2&quot;. And click <cite>OK</cite>.</p>
<p>You can see which server is selected at any time in the <cite>Settings</cite> 
tab.</p>
<h3>2. Create the new project</h3>
<p>Now that we have a server selected, we can create a new project. Note that if 
you do not have a server selected when creating a new project Borneo will prompt 
you to select one.</p>
<p>Select the command <cite>New Project</cite> from the <cite>File</cite> menu.</p>
<p>Enter the name of the project. The name must be a valid filename (so do not 
use characters forbidden in filenames).</p>
<p>Enter the project directory. The directory does not need to exist yet, Borneo 
will create all the path if necessary. Note that if you are using the MySQL server, instead of the project directory, 
you will be prompted for the directory were the stored files will reside. It 
must be a shared network directory.</p>
<h3>3. Set the source root</h3>
<p>Go to the <cite>Documents</cite> tab, and click the button with &quot;...&quot; just 
after the <cite>Source root</cite> display.</p>
<p>Enter the root directory of your source documents.</p>
<p>This is the common root for all the source documents that will go into the 
project. Choose it carefully, it determine the relative path for each source 
documents. It will be also used to calculate the location of the target 
documents in some cases.</p>
<p>Click <cite>OK</cite> when you have enter the root.</p>
<h3>4. Define the project's settings</h3>
<p>Go back to the <cite>Settings</cite> tab, click the <cite>Modify Settings</cite> 
button. This will allow you to change the source language for the project, as 
well as the default encoding for the source files. The source language must be a 
valid ISO language code, for example &quot;EN-US&quot;. The encoding must be a valid 
encoding name such as &quot;windows-1252&quot; for example. Click <cite>Accept Changes</cite> 
to save your changes, or <cite>Discard Changes</cite> to cancel them.</p>
<p>You need also to add the target languages for the project. To do this, click 
the <cite>Add</cite> button in the Target language area.</p>
<p>In the <cite>Add Target Languages</cite> dialog box, select the languages you 
want to add in the <cite>Available languages</cite> list, and click on <cite>Add</cite> 
to move them to the <cite>Language to add</cite> list. Once you have selected 
all the languages you needed, click <cite>OK</cite> to add the languages to the 
project.</p>
<p>The next step is to set up the properties of each target language.</p>
<p>Select the target language for which you want to change the properties, and 
click <cite>Properties</cite>.</p>
<p>The <cite>Target Language Properties</cite> dialog box has several parameters that you can 
change:</p>
<ul>
	<li><cite>Default encoding</cite>: It is the encoding used for the 
	translated documents generated by Borneo (if no encoding is defined for a 
	given target document).</li>
	<li><cite>Output root</cite>: This is an optional root to use instead of the 
	source root. Leave the field empty to use the same root as the source 
	document.</li>
	<li><cite>Default path mapping</cite>: These are the parameters that specify 
	how the target document to named (if no path mapping is defined for a given 
	target document). You can modify the filename's extension, replace some 
	characters by others, add a prefix or a suffix, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the changes you make are reflected immediately at the bottom of the 
dialog box, where an example of the path of the source document is mapped with 
your parameters and displayed as it would be used for the target document.</p>
<p>Click <cite>OK</cite> when you have set you parameters.</p>
<h2>Example of Process</h2>
<h3>1. Add the document to the project</h3>
<p>Add a document to localize to the project by dropping it in the list of 
source documents in the <cite>Documents</cite> tab. You can also use the <cite>
Add Documents</cite> command from the <cite>Documents</cite> menu.</p>
<h3>2. Set the source document properties</h3>
<p>Each document is associated to a filter and a default encoding. Borneo tries 
to guess these properties for you when you add the document to the project, but 
you may need to set them manually too. To do this: Select the documents in the 
Documents tab and use the <cite>Edit Source Document Properties</cite> command 
from the <cite>Documents</cite> menu.</p>
<p>The <cite>Source Document Properties</cite> dialog opens. Change the filter 
settings and default encoding as needed, and click <cite>OK</cite>.</p>
<h3>3. Extract the translatable item into the source table</h3>
<p>To extract the translatable text from the document into the source table: 
Select the <cite>Extract Source Documents</cite> command from the <cite>Source</cite> 
menu.</p>
<p>The <cite>Execute Action</cite> dialog box opens. This dialog box is used 
each time you launch an action.</p>
<p>Select what documents you 
want to process:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All of them</li>
	<li>Only the documents that have been selected when you called this command.</li>
	<li>Only the last selected document (its name is displayed at the bottom of 
	the dialog)</li>
</ul>
<p>Click <cite>Execute</cite> to start the action. Borneo calls the filters 
associated with each document and extract the text seen as translatable by the 
filter into the source table. The extracted items are flagged as <cite>Pending</cite>. 
You can list them in the <cite>Source</cite> tab by setting the check box 
labeled <cite>Show only pending items</cite>. Note that you may have already 
non-pending items for this document if you have done any extraction and updates 
before.</p>
<p>Note that if your input document is a bilingual file with existing 
translation (like a PO file), or if there are existing translated version of the 
source document (like for a Properties file), the existing translations is not 
lost. we will see how to take it into account later on.</p>
<h3>4. Review the pending items</h3>
<p>At this point you may want to review the pending items to see if the filter 
worked as expected. If you need to tune-up the parameters of the filter you can 
do this and simply re-extract the items again with the same command.</p>
<p>This step before the next one is important because the next step changes the 
status of the extracted items in the project and normally must be done only once 
for each new version of the source document, otherwise the status of the items 
may be incorrect.</p>
<p>Once you have verified the pending items, you can move to the next step.</p>
<h3>5. Update the source table</h3>
<p>To update the source table: Select the command <cite>Update Source Table</cite> 
from the <cite>Source</cite> menu.</p>
<p>Use the <cite>Execute Action</cite> dialog to specify the scope of the action 
and click <cite>Execute</cite>.</p>
<p>This action takes the pending items and compare them to any existing item 
already in the source table. The status of each item is updated according the 
changes brought up by the pending items (which are the latest version of the 
source document). Make sure to un-check the check box <cite>Show only pending 
items</cite> to see the normal source table.</p>
<h3>6. Update the target table</h3>
<p>The next step is to update the target table for each target language of the 
project: Select the command <cite>Update Target Table</cite> from the <cite>
Target</cite> menu.</p>
<p>Use the <cite>Execute Action</cite> dialog to specify the scope of the 
action. This time, you can also select the scope of the target: either the one 
currently selected (see it in the toolbar) or all target languages. Click <cite>
Execute</cite> to start the update.</p>
<p>This action copy the items of the source table into the target table, and 
update the status according the changes.</p>
<h3>7. Import existing translations</h3>
<p>TODOC</p>
<h3>8. Export the translation package</h3>
<p>If some items need translations or edit, you can export them into a 
translation package and send them away. The exported files can be merged back 
into the project at any time. If some update has occurred while the files were 
out for translation or edit, the status are updated accordingly.</p>
<p>To export a package: Select the command <cite>Export Translation Package</cite> 
from the <cite>Target</cite> menu.</p>
<p>Use the <cite>Execute Action</cite> dialog to specify the scope of the 
action. Click the <cite>Action Options</cite> button to set the export options.</p>
<p>The package is output in the XF sub-directory (eXchange Folder) in the 
Project directory.</p>
<h3>9. Translate the document</h3>
<p>The translation is done outside Borneo, with any translation tool that 
supports one of the translation package formats generated by Borneo.</p>
<h3>10. Import the translation package</h3>
<p>To import the exported packages back into the project you need to get the 
package back from the translator. He or she should not modify the structure or 
the names of the files, or touch the manifest file. Under these conditions, 
merging back a package (or some files in a package) is easily done:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Drag and drop the Manifest.xml file of the package you want to 
import in the main list of the <cite>Documents</cite> tab, or select the command
<cite>Import Translation Package</cite> from the <cite>Target</cite> menu to 
select the Manifest.xml to use.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once a manifest is selected, Borneo opens a dialog box where you 
can select which files of the package you want to import back.</p>
<h3>11. Verify the translated items</h3>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3>12. Generate the target document</h3>
<p class="note"><b>Note:</b><br>
<br>
Before executing this action, make sure the path mapping for the target 
documents is set as you expect.</p>
<p>Once your documents are translated in the project, you want to generate the 
translated final files. Select the command <cite>Generate Target Documents</cite> 
from the <cite>Target</cite> menu.</p>
<p>Use the <cite>Execute Action</cite> dialog to specify the scope of the action 
and click <cite>Execute</cite>.</p>
<p>This action takes the translated items from the target table and generate a 
target file, based on the source document that was used last for the <cite>
Update Target Table</cite> action. The document is output in the location and 
with the filename that you specify in the target properties for each target 
language.</p>
