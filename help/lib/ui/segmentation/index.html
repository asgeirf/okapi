<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>SRX (Segmentation Rules eXchange) is a standard format to store segmentation 
rules. You can find the specifications of SRX 2.0 here:
<a href="http://www.lisa.org/fileadmin/standards/srx20.html">
http://www.lisa.org/fileadmin/standards/srx20.html</a>.</p>
<p>Segmentation rules are used to indicate to translation and other 
linguistic-oriented tools how to split a text into small meaningful sequence of 
words (for example in sentences).</p>
<p>This editor can load SRX version 1.0 documents, but they will be saved as 
version 2.0 documents. You will be warned both when opeing and saving SRX 1.0 
documents. Be aware that versions 1.0 and 2.0 of SRX may be 
incompatible depending on how the version 1.0 document was interpreted by the 
tool that created the file. For more information about SRX versions, see the
<a href="srxversions.html">SRX Versions</a> section.</p>
