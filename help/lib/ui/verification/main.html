<body>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
	<tr class="head">
		<td class="head" colspan="2"><h1 class="head">CheckMate</h1>
		<h2 class="head2">Main Window</h2></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The main window is divided in two parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The upper part shows the source and traget text of the item where the 
	issue currently selected is located.</li>
	<li>The lower part shows the list of issues detected. Which issues are 
	displayed depends on several options.</li>
</ul>
<p>The table displays the issues found with the documents in the session. Use
<cite>Check All</cite> to re-process the documents if you fix or modify one.</p>
<p>Which issues are displayed in the table is driven by the two list-boxes below 
the table on the right-hand side:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The first one selects the types of issue to display: Choose <cite>&lt;All 
	types of issues&gt;</cite> to display issues of any types.</li>
	<li>The second one selects where to display enabled and disabled issues. An
	<b>enabled issue</b> (an <b>issue with a check mark</b>) is an issue that is 
	concidered valid (i.e. a real problem), while a <b>disabled issue</b> (an 
	issue <b>without check mark</b>) is an issue that is, in the context where 
	it occurs, not a problem (i.e. a non-issue), in other words: a false 
	positive. usually you want to display only the issues that are enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>To toggle the status of a given issue between enabled or disabled, simply 
check or uncheck its corresponding check mark. You can click on the check box, 
or select the issue and press the <kbd>Space</kbd> key. You can select multiple 
issues at the same time by holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key pressed while moving 
the cursor up or down.</p>
<p>You can sort the issues in the table by clicking on the header of each 
column. Note that the <cite>Text Unit</cite> and <cite>Seg</cite> columns are 
sorted by IDs and those IDs are alphanumeric, not numeric (e.g. the ID can be 
&quot;tu1&quot; not always &quot;1&quot;). When the IDs happend to be using only numbers, the sort 
may look strange as &quot;101&quot; comes after &quot;1001&quot; (where you may expect to see 101 to 
come before 1001).</p>
<p><cite>Check All</cite> -- Click this button to run the verification on all 
documents in the session.</p>
<p><cite>Settings</cite> -- Click this button to open the <cite>
<a href="sessionsettings.html">Session Settings</a></cite> 
dialog box, where you can add or removed the documents in the session, and edit 
other parameters.</p>
<p><cite>Options</cite> -- Click this button to open the <cite>
<a href="parameterseditor.html">Quality Check Options</a></cite> 
dialog box, where you can specify what kind of verifications to perform.</p>
<p><cite>Refresh</cite> -- Click this button to refresh the display of the list 
of issues. This does not re-process the documents, just refresh the list. This 
action is done automatically when you change the selection of one of the two 
list-boxes used to filter what issues are displayed.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the main window, the status bar indicates:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the current issue selected</li>
	<li>how many issues are listed in the table</li>
	<li>how many issues there are in total (listed and hidden)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: &quot;<code>5 / 17 / T=23</code>&quot; indicates that you are on the fifth 
issue of the table, which lists 17 issues, and that there are 23 issues in 
total.</p>
