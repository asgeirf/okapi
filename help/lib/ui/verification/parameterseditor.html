<h2><a name="parameters"></a>Parameters</h2>
<h3>General Tab</h3>
<p>Note: a <i>text unit</i> in the Okapi tools corresponds to a unit of 
extracted text, for example a paragraph in HTML or OpenOffice, a string table in 
a&nbsp; Properties file, etc. while a <i>segment</i> is the unit resulting from 
a segmentation. A text unit is composed of one or more segments and possible 
inter-segment parts. When a text unit has not been segmented it is seen as 
having a single segment. Some document may have been segmented, like XLIFF. 
Other are typically not segmented, like TMX where each <code>&lt;tu&gt;</code> entry 
corresponds to a text unit (and therefore a single segment).</p>
<h4>Text unit verification</h4>
<p>Verifications that are done on the whole content of each text unit:</p>
<p><cite>Warn if an entry does not have a translation</cite> -- This 
verification is always done. It checks if each entry has a corresponding 
translation. That is there is no entry for the given target language 
corresponding to the source entry. Empty translations are chcked in the option:
<cite>Warn if a target segment is empty</cite>.</p>
<p><cite>Warn if some possibly corrupted characters are found in the target 
entry</cite> -- Set this option to check for special patterns that often 
indicate a file with corrupted characters. For example a UTF-8 file opens as 
ISO-8859-1, etc. This feature does not found all possible cases of corrupted 
characters, only some of the frequent ones.</p>
<p><cite>Warn if a target entry has a difference in leading white spaces</cite> -- Set this option&nbsp; to flag the text 
units where the leading white spaces are different between source and target.</p>
<p><cite>Warn if a target entry has a difference in trailing white spaces</cite> -- Set this option to flag the text units 
where the trailing white spaces are different between source and target.</p>
<h4>Segment verification</h4>
<p>Verification that are done on each segment of each text unit (un-segmented 
text unit being seen as having a single segment):</p>
<p><cite>Warn if a source segment does not have a corresponding target</cite> -- 
This verification is always done. It checks if all source segments have a 
corresponding target segment. That is a source segment is identified with a 
segment ID that does not exist in the target text unit.</p>
<p><cite>Warn if there is an extra target segment</cite> -- This verification is 
always done. It checks if all target segments correspond to an existing source 
segment.</p>
<p><cite>Warn if a target segment is empty when its source is not empty</cite> -- Set this option to flag the segments for 
which the translation is empty (if the corresponding source is not empty).</p>
<p><cite>Warn if a target segment is not empty when its source is empty</cite> -- Set this option to flag the segments for 
which the target is not empty while its source is empty.</p>
<p><cite>Warn if a target segment is the same as its source</cite> -- Set this option to flag the 
segments where the translation is the same as the source. This check is done 
only if the source segment contain text.</p>
<p><cite>Include the codes in the comparison</cite> -- Set this option if the 
comparison done when verifying if the target is the same as the source should 
take inline codes into account. If this option is set and the only difference 
between the source and the translation is the inline code, the segment will not 
be flagged as having the target the same as the source.</p>
<p>Note that when a target is found to be the same as its source, the tool 
checks <a href="#PatternsTab">the list of patterns</a> that have their expected 
target set to &quot;<code>&lt;same&gt;</code>&quot;. If the string matches one of those patterns 
no warning is generated as the target is expected to be the same.</p>
<p><cite>Warn if there is a code differences between source and target segments</cite> -- Set this option to 
verify that the target content has the same inline codes as the source content.</p>
<p><cite>Warn on doubled words</cite> -- Set this option to flag the target 
segments where there is a sequential repetition of the same word, for example 
&quot;is is&quot; in &quot;this is is an example&quot;. The check is not case-sensitive, for example 
&quot;This this an example&quot; is flagged.</p>
<p><cite>Warn if a target is longer than the following percentage of the 
character length of its source</cite> -- Set this option to flag any target text 
that is longer than a given percentage of its source text. For example, if you 
enter 150%: If a source text is 20 characters long and its translation is more 
than 30 characters long, it will be flagged. The length is based on the number 
of characters without counting the inline codes. This value must be tuned for 
each source/target language pair.</p>
<p><cite>Warn if a target is shorter than the following percentage of the 
character length of its source</cite> -- Set this option to flag any target text 
that is shorter than a given percentage of its source text. For example, if you 
enter 50%: If a source text is 40 characters long and its translation is less 
than 20 characters long, it will be flagged. The length is based on the number 
of characters without counting the inline codes. This value must be tuned for 
each source/target language pair.</p>
<h3><a name="PatternsTab"></a>Patterns Tab</h3>
<p><cite>Verify that the following source patterns are translated as expected</cite> 
-- Set this option to verify that each source pattern defined in the list has 
its corresponding expected part in the target content.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The first column of the table indicates if the pattern should be 
	verified or not, and indicates the potential level of severity for this 
	check.</li>
	<li>The second column is the regular expression of the pattern to look for in 
the source.</li>
	<li>The third column is the target pattern corresponding to the part 
found in the source. If the part should be the same as in the source, just use 
the &quot;<code>&lt;same&gt;</code>&quot; keyword.</li>
	<li>The fourth column is a short 
description of the rule.</li>
</ul>
<p><cite>Add</cite> -- Click this buttion to add a new pattern to the list.</p>
<p><cite>Edit</cite> -- Click this button to edit the pattern currently 
selected. You can also double-click the pattern in the table.</p>
<p><cite>Remove</cite> -- Click this button to remove the pattern currently 
selected from the table.</p>
<p><cite>Move Up</cite> -- Click this button to move the pattern currently 
selected upward in the table.</p>
<p><cite>Move Down</cite> -- Click this button to move the pattern currently 
selected downward in the table.</p>
<p><cite>Import</cite> -- Click this button to import an existing file in the 
table.</p>
<p><cite>Export</cite> -- Click this button to export the patterns in the table 
to a tab-delimited file.</p>
<h3>LanguageTool Tab</h3>
<p><cite>Perform the verifications provided by the LanguageTool server</cite> 
-- Set this option to run the verifications provided by a LanguageTool server. 
To use this option you must have access to <a href="http://www.languagetool.org">
LanguageTool Checker</a> run as a server. Most of the time this is simply a 
local server. You can start the application with Java Web Start:
<a href="http://www.languagetool.org/webstart/web/LanguageTool.jnlp">Start 
LanguageTool Checker from the Web</a>.</p>
<p><cite>Auto-translate the messages from the LanguageTool checker</cite> - Set 
this option to have the messages coming from the languageTool checker translated 
into a given language. Most of the time, the error messages of LanguageTool when 
checking for a given language are provided in the same language as the text 
verified (e.g. verifying a Polish text will give you back error messages in 
Polish). Use this option to have the messages automatically
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/">translated using Google MT</a> 
and displayed along with the original messages.</p>
<p><cite>From</cite> -- Enter the language of the original messages (e.g. <code>
po</code> for Polish).</p>
<p><cite>Into</cite> -- Enter the code of the language into which you want to 
translate the messages (e.g. <code>en</code> for English)</p>
<h3>Output Tab</h3>
<p><cite>Path of the report file</cite> -- Enter the full path of the HTML 
report to generate. You can use the variable <code>${rootDir}</code> in the 
path.</p>
<p><cite>Open the report after completion</cite> -- Set this option to 
automatically open the report file after the process is complete.</p>
