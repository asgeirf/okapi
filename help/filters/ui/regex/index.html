<h1 class="filt1">Filters – Regex Filter</h1>
<h2 class="filt2">Overview</h2>
<p>This filter allows you to process any type of text-based formats where the 
text can be captured using regular expressions.</p>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<h3>Rules Tab</h3>
<p><cite>Add</cite> -- Click this button to add a new rule to the list. This 
opens the <cite><a href="editrule.html">Edit Rule</a></cite> dialog box with the new rule.</p>
<p><cite>Rename</cite> -- Click this button to rename the rule currently 
selected. Note that two rules can have the same name, but this is obviously not 
recommended.</p>
<p><cite>Remove</cite> -- Click this button to delete the rule currently 
selected from the list. No confirmation is asked.</p>
<p><cite>Edit</cite> -- Click this button to edit the rule currently selected. 
This opens the <cite><a href="editrule.html">Edit Rule</a></cite> dialog box.</p>
<p><cite>Move Up</cite> -- Click this button to move the rule currently selected 
up in the list. Rules are evaluated in the order of the list.</p>
<p><cite>Move Down</cite> -- Click this button to move the rule currently 
selected down in the list. Rules are evaluated in the order of the list.</p>
<h4>Rule properties</h4>
<p><cite>Action</cite> -- Select the type of action to perform for the rule 
currently selected. There are four choices:</p>
<ul>
	<li><cite>Extract the strings inside the content</cite>: Extracts each 
	strings within the content into a separate text unit.</li>
	<li><cite>Extract the content itself</cite>: Extracts the whole text of the 
	content into a single text unit.</li>
	<li><cite>Treat the content as a comment</cite>: Does not extract anything, 
	but process the content as a comment and search for localization directives 
	if that option is set.</li>
	<li><cite>Do not extract the content</cite>: Leaves the content alone.</li>
</ul>
<p><cite>Preserve white spaces</cite> -- Set this option to preserve all white 
spaces of the extracted text. If this option is not set the extracted content is 
unwrapped: That is any sequence of consecutive white spaces is replaced by a 
single space character, and any white space character at the start or the end of 
the content is trimmed out. White spaces here are: spaces, tabs, carriage 
returns, and line-feeds.</p>
<p><cite>Has inline codes</cite> -- Set this option to enable the conversion of 
some part of the extracted text into inline codes.</p>
<p><cite>Edit Inline Codes Patterns</cite> -- Click this button to open the 
Inline Codes Patterns dialog box where you can define rules for converting parts 
of text into inline codes.</p>
<h4>Regular expressions options</h4>
<p>This set of options are used for all rules defined in the list. If you need 
to overwrite an option for a given rule, use the <code>(?idmsux-idmsux)</code> 
construct in the pattern for that rule.</p>
<p><cite>Dot also matches line-feed</cite> -- Set this option to enable the dot 
operator to match line-feeds.</p>
<p><cite>Multi-line</cite> -- Set this option so the expressions <code>^</code> 
and <code>$</code> match just after or just before, respectively, a line 
terminator or the end of the input sequence. If this option is not set these 
expressions only match at the beginning and the end of the entire input 
sequence.</p>
<p><cite>Ignore case differences</cite> -- Set this option to ignore differences 
between letter cases. If this option is set &quot;abc&quot; is seen as identical as &quot;Abc&quot;. 
If this option is not set, both strings are seen as different.</p>
<h3>Options Tab</h3>
<h4>Localization directives</h4>
<p><cite>Use localization directives when they are present</cite> -- Set this 
option to TODO</p>
<p><cite>Extract items outside the scope of localization directives</cite> -- 
Set this option to TODO</p>
<h4>Strings</h4>
<p><cite>Extract strings outside the rules</cite> -- Set this option to extract 
all strings that are outside the scope of all the defined rules. NOT IMPLEMENTED 
YET.</p>
<p><cite>Beginning of string</cite> -- Enter the character specifying the start 
of a string. Entering several characters defines several ways to start a string.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>End of string</cite> -- Enter the character specifying the 
end of a string. If you have defined several beginning characters, you must 
defined an equal number of end characters, and the position of each end 
character must correspond to the position of its corresponding beginning 
character.</p>
<h4>Content type</h4>
<p><cite>MIME type of the document</cite> -- Enter TODO</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
