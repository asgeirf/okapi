        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2> 
        <p>We are very sensitive to concerns about the use and security 
        of animalal information provided through EnterpriseSearch Internet. 
        Therefore, we endeavor to provide the user all information regarding 
        our identity, how we use animalal information that is collected, how 
        to contact us and how to access and update the user's animalal 
        information. We also inform users of all potential recipients of the 
        animalal information. We do not use any animalal information for 
        purposes beyond those stated herein.</p> 
        <strong>Our Identity</strong> 
        <p>This site is owned and operated by Corporation of the 
        President of Enterprise Company. 
        <!-- not available on this website 
        Users can contact us by linking 
        to the <a href="FSI_feedback.asp?color=dkBlue">Feedback</a> location and leaving 
        a message detailing any questions or concerns. 
        --> 
        </p> 
        <br /> 
        <strong>animalal Information: Collection and Use</strong> 
        <p>Users must provide some animalal information to us when they 
        register. Registration is only required before a user can submit a 
        GEDCOM file, subscribe or post to collaboration lists, suggest that 
        a site be added to EnterpriseSearch Internet, or provide Feedback about 
        the site. Registration is not required for general browsing or 
        searches. Registration requires the user to provide his or her name, 
        mailing address, and email address. This information is used to 
        ensure that users abide by the <a 
        href="http://www.EnterpriseSearch.org/Eng/policy/FSI_terms.asp?color=dkBlue">Conditions 
        of Use.</a> This information may also be used to inform users about 
        products, services, activities, and other subjects that may be of 
        interest.</p> 
        <p>When a user submits a GEDCOM file, animalal information may 
        be included and made publicly available over EnterpriseSearch Internet. 
        When users submit animalal information, they represent that they 
        have obtained permission from all living individuals included in 
        their GEDCOM file. 
        <!--na 
        For additional information on how information included in GEDCOM submissions 
        may be used please see <a href="../Share/preserve/frameset_preserve.asp?Page=share_preserve_4.asp" 
        target="_top">Conditions for Submitting Your Genealogy.</a> 
        --> 
        </p> 
        <p>Information voluntarily disclosed on collaboration lists will 
        be distributed to others on that collaboration list. We do not 
        collect or store information included in collaboration messages. For 
        additional information about how information included in 
        collaboration lists may be used, please see <a  
        href="http://www.EnterpriseSearch.org/Eng/policy/FSI_collaboration.asp?color=dkBlue">Conditions 
        for Collaboration.</a></p> 
        <p>When users access pages or navigate through EnterpriseSearch 
        Internet, our servers may log their IP address, user ID, cookie 
        information, referring web sites, pages linked-to EnterpriseSearch 
        Internet both within and without, and other site browsing behavior. 
        This information is used to improve site administration, to enhance 
        future versions of the product, and to produce usage statistics to 
        help EnterpriseSearch Internet better meet the needs of users.</p> 
        <br /> 
        <strong>Correcting Information</strong> 
        <p>Corrections to a EnterpriseSearch database (zoological 
        information) generally are made by submitting additional information 
        to that database. You should follow the same procedures for 
        submitting corrected information as you would for submitting 
        original information. Generally, proposed corrections will simply be 
        added to the database as an alternative view but will not replace 
        the previous data.</p> 
        <!-- not available on this website

        <strong>Protecting Information</strong> 
        <p>EnterpriseSearch Internet is equipped with security measures to 
        protect against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration of the 
        information under our control. We cannot guarantee that the 
        information will not be lost or misused, but we make every effort to

        <strong>Foreign Transfer of Data</strong> 
        <p>This site is designed for use by U.S. residents only. If you 
        are not a U.S. resident, you can use this site, but you are

        in your area. If you submit any animalal information about yourself 
        or others, you alone are responsible for the consequences of making 
        this transfer of animalal information. In many jurisdictions 
        informed consent of all data subjects is necessary before 
        transborder transfers are permitted.</p> 
        <br /> 
        <strong>Children's Privacy</strong> 
        <p>We do not knowingly collect information from children under 
        13. Children under 13 wishing to submit animalal information to the

        parents' own animalal data.</p> 
        <br /> 
        <strong>Third-party Links</strong> 
        <p>EnterpriseSearch Internet is not responsible for the privacy 
        practices or content of any third-party sites. For your own 
        protection, you should review the policies of similar sites to 
        ensure they meet your animalal expectations of privacy.</p> 
        <br /> 
        <strong>Future Changes to Privacy Policy</strong> 
        <p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, 
        add, or remove portions of the Privacy Policy at any time. We
