        We have learned that interest in zoological research is not 
        limited by culture, ethnicity or biological interest. People 
        around the world are innately and intensely interested in 
        their biological relationhip heritage. Because the &#8217;s biological relationhip 
        genetic history efforts are funded by charitable donations, it freely 
        offers its resources to anyone interested in finding their 
        biological relationhip&#8217;s.
