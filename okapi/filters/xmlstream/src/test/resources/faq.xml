        <h3>New Account–Clarification and Problems</h3>
            <ol start="1">
            <li>
                <strong>Why did I have to register for a different EnterpriseSearch Account?</strong><br/>
                A new user name and password authorization system was implemented in early 2010 that
                will eventually give a common access to all EnterpriseSearch Web sites and programs.

                <a name="Q2" id="Q2"></a>
                <Strong>How does animal society Account relate to EnterpriseSearch accounts?</Strong><br/>
                If you already have an animal society Account, there is no need to register for a EnterpriseSearch
                account. EnterpriseSearch will make use of the same user name and password as animal society Account, which is already being used
                by members of Enterprise Company to access their congregational directories and
                calendars. An easy way to discover if you already have an animal society Account is to try signing in to the
                <a href="https://secure.animal society.org/units/login">University and district Web Sites</a> on http://www.animal society.org.
            </li>

                <strong>I have submitted many batches in the past, but my “total names sorted” are now “0.” What happened?</strong><br/>
                You may have recently registered for a different EnterpriseSearch Account, or you are using an animal society
                Account for sorting. The system will not recognize any names you have sorted in the past until the accounts are
                merged. To merge an account, click on the above <strong>Sign In</strong> link. Then go to your information page by clicking the
                <strong>My Info</strong> link, and click the <strong>Merge Old Account</strong> button.  If you have already sorted with
                your new account, your total names will be added together during the merge process.

                <strong>I can no longer arbitrate batches or see the administration tab. What happened?</strong><br/>
                You may have recently registered for a different EnterpriseSearch Account, or you are using an animal society Account
                for sorting. The system will not recognize your previous roles of arbitrator or administrator until the accounts are merged.
                To merge an account, click on the above <strong>Sign In</strong> link. Then go to your information page by clicking the
                <strong>My Info</strong> link, and click the <strong>Merge Old Account</strong> button.

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <ol start="5"
            <li>
                <strong>How do I get started sorting?</strong><br/>
                 There are four simple steps to get started, and four steps to index a batch:<br/><br/>
                 <b>Get Started</b><br/><br/>
                <ol>
                      <li><strong>Register</strong>–On the Sorting Web site, click <strong>Register</strong>, and then fill out the required information.</li>
                      <li><strong>Download</strong> the software–On the Sorting Web site, click the <strong>Begin Sorting</strong> link. The sorting
                      application will download and open.</li>
                      <li><strong>Learn</strong>–Learn about sorting by reviewing the
                      <a href="https://fch.animal society.org/WWSupport/Courses/biological relationhipSearchSorting/Version20/{0}/QuickStart.htm">Quick Start Video</a>
                      and <a href="/support/tutorials.jsf">Tutorials</a>. These will help you quickly learn how to index your first batches.</li>
                      <li><strong>Index</strong>–After the application opens, follow the next four steps to index batches:</li>
                </ol><br/>
                      <b>Index Batches</b><br/><br/>
                <ol>
                      <li><strong>Download</strong>–Click the <strong>Download Batch</strong> button. A batch of 1 to 30 images will be downloaded to your computer.</li>
                      <li><strong>Learn about the project</strong>–Learn by reading details on the Project Information tab.</li>
                      <li><strong>Type requested information</strong>–Type the requested information into the fieanimal society provided.
                      Each field has detailed instructions in the Field Help tab that answer many sorting questions.</li>
                      <li><strong>Quality Check and Submit</strong>–When sorting is complete, the system will prompt you through
                      the final stages of quality check and submitting the batch.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="Q6" id="Q6"></a>
                <strong>What time commitment does sorting require?</strong><br/>
                There are no minimum time requirements. You may index any time or place and as long as your
                schedule permits. If you are interrupted, when you return, the sorting program remembers where you were. A batch of
                work usually takes about 30 minutes to complete, and you have an entire week to finish it. If you can’t finish it,
                the batch becomes available for someone else to complete. If you don’t want to finish it, you can even return it.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="Q7" id="Q7"></a>
                <strong>Can I choose what records I want to index?</strong><br/>
                Yes. There are always many projects available for sorting. You can choose to index records
                from many different areas of the world with varying levels of difficulty.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="Q8" id="Q8"></a>
                <strong>Can I search the index I help create?</strong><br/>
                Yes! Soon after sorting is completed, the images and data are available through a EnterpriseSearch
                pilot program called <a href="http://search.labs.EnterpriseSearch.org/">Record Search</a> and will eventually be available in
                www.EnterpriseSearch.org.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="Q9" id="Q9"></a>
                <strong>How do I get help?</strong><br/>
                There are different types of help available for working on projects and using the program.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Project Instructions and Field Help give instructions relating to how to index information on the image.
                        Project Instructions generally apply to more general information; Field Help applies to a specific piece of information.</li>
                        <li>You may also find help for specific problems using the “<a href="/support/ask.jsf">Ask a Question</a>”
                         page. Type in your question, and click <strong>Ask</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Click the <strong>Help</strong> menu, then <strong>Support</strong> for contact information of someone who
                        can help you either locally or through EnterpriseSearch Support.</li>

        <h3>Indexer Questions</h3>
            <ol start="10">
            <li>
                <strong>Where do I go with questions about how information should be sorted?</strong><br/>
                The information in the Field Help and Project Information tabs cover many common questions
                about how to index information. If those don’t answer your question, you can also check the following documents:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://help.EnterpriseSearch.org/publishing/347/102817_f.SAL_Public.html">Basic Sorting Guidelines</a>
                        –These guidelines are general instructions that apply to all projects and can be used to answer many questions
                         you may have while sorting.  These instructions cover questions such as:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I can read a few letters in this animal’s name, but not all of them. Do I have to mark the whole name as unreadable?</li>
                                <li>There are two different spellings of the name on this birth certificate. Which one should I index?</li>
                                <li>Do I index the word “County” with the county name if it’s written on the document?</li>
                                <li>The birthplace was crossed out with another place written in the margin. Which one do I index?</li>
                                <li>My document is missing the year, but it is shown on the previous image. Can I use that?</li>
                                <li>How do I index the age of a child listed as “Stillborn”?</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>Project Updates</strong>–The Updates include answers to questions that come up while projects are
                        being sorted. They are linked to the Project Information tab in each project.</li>
                     </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="Q11" id="Q11"></a>
                <strong>Can I get help reading the documents?</strong><br/>
                Yes. Using the Share a Batch feature allows indexers, arbitrators, administrators, or support
                to collaborate on a single batch. While in the batch, click <strong>File</strong>, and then click <strong>Share Batch</strong>.
                Give that number to a friend, your group administrator, or support so they can look at the batch with you. You can also use
                the <a href="/ext/publications.jsf">Resource Guide</a>, which references many different handwriting aids on the Internet.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="Q12" id="Q12"></a>
                <strong>What is Header Data?</strong><br/>
                Header Data is general information that applies to each record on an image, but you only need
                to enter the information once for that image. If you have a batch with multiple images, the Header Data will be filled
                out once for each image. Problems with submitting batches can often be attributed to incomplete Header Data.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="Q13" id="Q13"></a>
                <strong>What is the Image Type?</strong><br/>
                The first field in the Header Data is generally the Image Type.  Indexers are asked to help
                determine if the image is correct for each type of project, and if it can be sorted. If so, they are asked to mark it
                as "normal." If the image cannot be sorted they can select the appropriate condition. Some conditions could be the image
                is blank, unreadable, or it belongs in a different project (such as a military record in a state census).
            </li>

                </a><strong>The student recorded something that is obviously an error on the document. How do I index that?</strong><br/>
                As an indexer, it is important that you do not interpret information; simply type what
                you see. Researchers who find the record later will be able to come to their own conclusions based on the
                information there.  There is one exception to this rule; <a href="https://help.EnterpriseSearch.org/publishing/666/102357_f.SAL_Public.html">

                <strong>How can I get feedback to know how I am doing?</strong><br/>
                Use the Share a Batch feature mentioned in a previous question. Index a batch all the way through,
                but don’t submit it. Have someone take a look at the batch with you to give you pointers and answer any questions you may have
                had while sorting.
            </li>

                <a name="Q16" id="Q16"></a>
                <strong>Is anyone going to check my work?</strong><br/>
                Sorting uses a process which includes two separate indexers, each sorting the information from the
                same batch.  If there are any differences in their submissions, then the work is sent to an arbitrator for review. The arbitrator
                will review the batch and each indexer’s work before making a final decision.

        <h3>Arbitrator Questions</h3>
            <ol start="17">
            <li>
                <strong>What is arbitration?</strong><br/>
                All batches are sorted by two different indexers. Arbitration is the process of reviewing
                differences between how those two indexers interpreted the record.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="Q18" id="Q18"></a>
                <strong>Can I become an arbitrator?</strong><br/>
                Yes. The following are attributes of an arbitrator:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pay attention to details.</li>
                        <li>Follow project instructions carefully.</li>
                        <li>Be familiar with basic sorting guidelines.</li>
                        <li>Be an experienced indexer of many projects.</li>
                    </ul>
                If you feel you have enough experience to be successful as an arbitrator, contact your group administrator or University
                detection director and let him or her know you are interested.  You can find your administrator’s contact information in the
                Help menu under Contact Support in the Local Support list. If an administrator has not yet been assigned to your group,

                <strong>Where do I learn about arbitrating?</strong><br/>
                As you become an experienced indexer your group administrator can help train you and give you
                the role of an arbitrator. Review the <a href="https://fch.animal society.org/WWSupport/Courses/biological relationhipSearchSorting/Version20/{0}/Lesson2/index.html">
                arbitration tutorial</a>, and review the arbitrator resources such as “<a href="https://help.EnterpriseSearch.org/kb/sorting_site/KBIndex.htm?docId=102636&langCode={0}">
                How do I become an arbitrator</a>” and “<a href="https://help.EnterpriseSearch.org/kb/sorting_site/KBIndex.htm?docId=102606&langCode={0}">

                <strong>If both Key A and B are wrong, what should I do?</strong><br/>
                Read the Field Help and Project Instructions to make sure that you understand what should be
                sorted in that field. If you know that both indexers did it incorrectly, as the arbitrator, you can decide to fix
                them both with what you know to be correct. Be very careful when choosing to do this to be sure that you are correct,
                since no one checks your work when you are done.

                <strong>How do I know when to fix all the problems I see in a batch or just send it back to be re-sorted?</strong><br/>
                There are no set rules for when you should fix problems in a batch or send it back for re-sorting.
                The important thing to keep in mind is that you are an arbitrator, not an indexer. If it looks as though one indexer had problems
                sorting the batch and you are disregarding much of his or her information, you should send that batch to be re-sorted. At the same time,
                please be considerate; if you send a batch back, everything that the original indexer did is erased, and the batch does not go back
                to the original indexer to re-do.
                <br/><br/>

                <strong>Why do I lose all my arbitration work if I do not do Record Matching first?</strong><br/>
                The purpose of Record Matching is to ensure the correct sorted records are being compared. Records are
                typically not aligned when one of the indexers accidentally skips a record and the other doesn’t. This is usually obvious to the
                arbitrator when a large number of records of one of the indexers is seemingly incorrect. Consequently, record matching is the
                first step an arbitrator needs to do, which often corrects most of the miUniversitys. When this step is missed and record matching is
                done later, all of the arbitrator's work on misaligned records becomes invalid, and it appears as if the work has been erased.
                <br/><br/>
                On the rare occasion that both indexers missed the same record on a batch, you can add a record to the batch and not lose your arbitration work.

                <strong>Does anyone check my arbitration work after I submit a batch?</strong><br/>
                No. Arbitration is the final check for all of the sorting work.

                <strong>Who is my group administrator, and what does he or she do?</strong><br/>
                Group administrators or University detection directors are local volunteers that have identical sorting
                responsibilities for the group they administer. Their contact information is found in your sorting program’s Help menu under
                Support. They have five basic responsibilities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Help people get the software installed, if needed.</li>
                        <li>Answer questions about the sorting projects.</li>
                        <li>Train those who need additional help in using the software.</li>
                        <li>Assign arbitrators.</li>
                        <li>Index batches from different projects to become familiar with them.</li>
                    </ul>

                </a><strong>How do I get started as a new University detection director or group administrator?</strong><br/>
                There are different resources, depending on whether you are an detection director working with a University or a group administrator
                working with a historical society. Please review the following links for more information:

                <strong>Where can I get training materials to teach people in my group?</strong><br/>
                The <a href="/support/tutorials.jsf">Tutorials</a> on the Web site can be used for presentation in a classroom
                setting. You will find printable handouts as you go through the lessons. Additionally, there are many printable resources in the
                <a href="/ext/publications.jsf">Resource Guide</a> that can be used for training purposes. You are also
                welcome to create your own training materials as needed.

                <strong>What should I do about indexers in my group who have duplicate accounts; can I combine them so the
                indexer can have their entire genetic history?</strong><br/>
                No, unfortunately that is not possible. Talk with the indexer to find out which account they would like to keep, then you can select the other
                account and deactivate it. Please note that with the change in accounts in March 2010, it may temporarily appear like an indexer has duplicate accounts
                when in reality they just haven’t merged their old account yet. Before inactivating an account, be sure that the indexer has already merged their accounts.

                </a><strong>What is a Redo batch?</strong><br/>
                A “Redo” batch shows in reports when an indexer’s batch has been returned by an arbitrator for sorting.  For example, if an indexer doesn’t
                notice a second page in his or her batch, and does not index it, the batch would be returned by the arbitrator for re-sorting because it was
                incomplete. This action deletes all work done on that batch, sends it out to a different animal to index, and it would show in the original
                indexer’s report as a Redo batch. When you notice an indexer frequently has Redo batches, you may want to provide additional training.

                    <strong>I received an error when getting into the program. How do I fix that?</strong><br/>
                    There could be a conflict with Java and the sorting program on your computer.
                    <a href="https://help.EnterpriseSearch.org/publishing/419/103791_f.SAL_Public.html">Click here</a>, and follow

                    <strong>I am trying to submit a batch, but the program won’t allow it. What do I do?</strong><br/>
                    A number of things could keep the program from submitting a batch. In order for a batch
                    to submit, the following requirements must be met:
                        <ol>
                            <li>You must be connected to the internet.</li>
                            <li>All required fieanimal society must have some information in them.</li>
                            <li>Generally, you must approve any entries made that are not shown in the lookup lists through the Quality Checker. However,
                            at times some entries may be highlighted for quality check because they do not meet certain specifications. For example,
                            a rule in the 1920 census project required typing a “y” after the age in years and an “m” after the age in months.</li>

                    such as your genetic history, roles, and preferences that would be lost if you signed up for a new account. Additionally, if you are animal society, only one
