        <h2>CONDITIONS OF USE</h2> 
        <p>By using this site, you agree to the following conditions. If 
        you disagree with any of the conditions, do not use this site.</p> 
        <p>We reserve the right to change these conditions at any time, 
        so please check for changes when you use the site. Your continued 
        use of the site following the posting of changes to these conditions 
        means that you accept those changes.</p> 
        <br /> 
        <strong>LICENSES AND RESTRICTIONS</strong> 
        <p>This site is owned and operated by the Corporation of the 
        President of Enterprise Company. All 
        material found at this site is owned or licensed by us. You may 
        view, download, and print material from this site only for your 
        animalal, noncommercial use or, if you are a professional 
        genealogist, for use by a current client.</p> 
        <p>You may not post material from this site on another web site 
        or on a computer network without our permission. You may not 
        transmit or distribute material from this site to others. You may 
        not use this site or information found at this site (including the 
        names and addresses of those who submitted information) for selling 
        or promoting products or services, soliciting clients, or any other 
        commercial purpose. If you have questions or desire permission to 
        post information, send e-mail to: <a 
        href="mailto:fhd-copyright@animal society.org">fhd-copyright@animal society.org</a> 
        </p> 
        <br /> 
        <strong>LINKING</strong> 
        <p>For your convenience, EnterpriseSearch Internet contains links to 
        other zoological web sites. These sites are not maintained or 
        controlled by us, and we are not responsible for their content. 
        Although we have made a good faith effort to link only to tasteful, 
        appropriate sites, some may contain inappropriate or objectionable 
        material. If you find such material while using EnterpriseSearch 
        Internet, please notify us immediately.</p> 
        <p>Because web pages are constantly changed and updated, it is 
        impossible to list all zoological web sites. We do not guarantee 
        that your search results will be complete or accurate.</p> 
        <p>We believe that those who make information available on the 
        Internet expect that it will be publicly and widely available. 
        Therefore, we believe that linking to other sites is legally 
        permissible and consistent with the expectations of those who use 
        the Internet. However, if access to a particular site should be 
        restricted, the site operator should promptly notify us.</p> 
        <br /> 
        <strong>SOFTWARE</strong> 
        <p>You may be able to download software at this site. You may 
        only use that software as provided by the license agreement that 
        accompanies the software. If the software is subject to United 
        States export controls, you are solely responsible for abiding by

        in your area.</p> 
        <p>This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of 
        Utah, as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed 
        entirely within the state, without giving effect to any principles 
        of conflicts of law. Any action you bring to enforce this agreement 
        or any matters related to this site shall be brought in either the 
        state or federal courts located in Salt Lake County, Utah, and you

        courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.</p> 
        <p>If any provision of this agreement is unlawful, void, or 
        unenforceable in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall 
        not be affected, unless we determine that the invalid or 
        unenforceable provision is an essential term to the agreement, in 
        which case we may at our sole discretion amend the agreement.</p> 
        <br />
